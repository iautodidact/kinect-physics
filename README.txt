kinect-physics
==============

Processing sketches to gather and analyze 3-D motion data with kinect. 
One creates a txt file that has four columns - t (ms), x, y, z. (uncalibrated position) -
tracking and recording the nearest point.
The other makes a 3-D scatter plot if given a txt file in this form.
